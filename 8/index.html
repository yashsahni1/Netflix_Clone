                <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the
                    company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition
                    and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course
                    and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                    most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <p style="color: black;">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p style="color: rgb(124, 121, 121); font-size: 15px;">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written
                    a
                    line of code. I needed some structure from
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and
                    staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
                    agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example
                    of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                    receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

                <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
                    learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
                <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
